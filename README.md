# Project OpenVision-Instruct

Fine-tuning LLaVA-OneVision on the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset to create a powerful, open-source model for advanced, instruction-based image understanding and editing.

The Vision: Democratizing Advanced Visual AI

In the current AI landscape, the most advanced capabilities for nuanced, instruction-based image manipulation often remain within the closed ecosystems of large tech companies. These "magic edit" features, while powerful, are typically offered as black-box APIs, limiting transparency, accessibility, and community-driven innovation.

This project aims to bridge that gap.

Our core mission is to take a highly efficient, open-source vision-language model and specialize it on a cutting-edge, publicly available dataset. The goal is to create a transparent, powerful, and accessible tool that provides state-of-the-art visual instruction-following capabilities, putting this power back into the hands of the open-source community, researchers, and individual creators.
The Components

This project stands on the shoulders of two incredible open-source efforts:

The Base Model: LLaVA-OneVision-1.5

*What it is*: A family of highly efficient, open-source Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).

*Why we chose it*: Its framework is explicitly designed for democratized, cost-effective training. It provides a state-of-the-art foundation in visual understanding with a parameter size that is feasible for fine-tuning on prosumer hardware.

The Fine-Tuning Dataset: OpenGPT-4o-Image

*What it is*: A comprehensive dataset designed for advanced image generation and editing. Its paper (arxiv:2509.24900) details a hierarchical taxonomy of complex visual tasks.

*Why we chose it*: It contains high-quality, diverse instruction-image pairs that are perfect for teaching a model to perform complex, multi-step, and nuanced visual reasoning and manipulation tasks.

## The Technical Approach

This project is made feasible by a specific, memory-efficient fine-tuning technique that allows us to adapt a multi-billion parameter model on a single GPU.

### Phase 1: Environment & Data Preparation

*Environment Setup*: Clone the official LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 repository and configure the necessary Python environment and dependencies. For detailed instructions, see the [Environment Setup Guide](./docs/setup.md).

*Asset Acquisition*: Download the target pre-trained model weights (e.g., the 4B or 8B variant) and the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset.

*Data Formatting*: Develop a script to parse and reformat the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset into the specific JSONL or conversational format required by the LLaVA fine-tuning scripts. This is a critical step to ensure the model can correctly interpret the instruction-image pairs.

### Phase 2: Fine-Tuning with QLoRA

Core Technology: We will use QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) for fine-tuning. This is the key to our hardware feasibility.

Process:
 - The base LLaVA model will be loaded in a quantized 4-bit precision, drastically reducing its memory footprint.
 - The weights of the base model will be frozen.
 - A very small number of trainable "adapter" layers will be added to the model.
 - Training will commence, updating only these tiny adapters. This allows us to fine-tune the model with a VRAM footprint that fits on a prosumer GPU.
 - Target Hardware: The initial fine-tuning runs will be targeted for an NVIDIA RTX 4090 with 24 GB of VRAM.

### Phase 3: Evaluation, Merging & Release

*Evaluation*: The model's performance will be evaluated through both quantitative metrics (if applicable benchmarks are available) and qualitative testing on a hold-out set of instructions from the dataset.

*Model Release*: Upon successful fine-tuning, the trained LoRA adapter weights will be merged with the original base model weights to create a final, standalone model.

*Distribution*: The final model will be released on Hugging Face under a permissive license, complete with a detailed model card explaining its capabilities, limitations, and usage.

## Our Philosophy & The Value We Hope to Generate

*Democratizing Technology*: To provide a powerful, open-source alternative to proprietary visual AI systems.

*Enabling Innovation*: To create a foundational tool that developers, researchers, and artists can use to build new applications and explore creative frontiers without relying on expensive APIs.

*Promoting Transparency*: To offer an auditable model where the training data and process are public, fostering trust and further research.

*Efficient AI*: To demonstrate that meaningful contributions to the AI space don't always require massive-scale data centers. By leveraging efficient techniques like QLoRA, we can create valuable assets with a minimal carbon footprint relative to training a model from scratch.

## How to Contribute

This is an open project, and community involvement is welcome. For now, the best way to contribute is to:

*Open an Issue*: To suggest features, report bugs, or discuss the project direction.

*Submit a Pull Request*: To contribute directly to the data processing scripts, training configurations, or documentation.
