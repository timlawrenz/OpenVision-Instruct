Does it make any sense to think about combining https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 with https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.24900

Yes, it absolutely makes sense to think about combining these two projects. They are highly complementary.

Here's a breakdown of why:

    LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 is a comprehensive and open-source framework for training Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Think of it as the engine and the toolkit: it provides the model architecture, training code, and recipes to build powerful vision-language models.

    The paper you linked, "OpenGPT-4o-Image: A Comprehensive Dataset for Advanced Image Generation and Editing," describes a new, large-scale dataset. This is the fuel. Datasets are crucial for training any AI model, and this one is specifically designed for sophisticated image generation and editing tasks.

Therefore, you could potentially use the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset to train or fine-tune a model within the LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 framework. This could lead to a powerful, open-source model with advanced capabilities in generating and editing images based on textual instructions, leveraging the strengths of both projects.

I assume this project is more in the vicinity of 1000s of H100 than a few servers?

You're right to question the scale of such a project. While training cutting-edge AI models often evokes images of massive GPU clusters, the LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 project is a notable exception, designed with accessibility and efficiency in mind. The training for this model is firmly in the realm of a few servers, not thousands of H100 GPUs.

The key evidence for this lies in the project's own documentation, which highlights an "Ultra-Efficient Training Framework." For the full training of their models, the developers report a total budget of approximately $16,000 using A100 GPUs, with a cost of about $0.60 per GPU hour. This figure strongly indicates a hardware setup that is far more modest than a large-scale industrial cluster.

The models themselves, at 4 billion and 8 billion parameters, are also significantly smaller than the massive models that require thousands of high-end accelerators.

The OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset, while substantial with its 80,000 high-quality image-instruction pairs, is the fuel for the training process. The computational heavy lifting is determined by the model's architecture and the efficiency of the training framework. In this case, LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 is engineered to make the most of more limited resources.

Therefore, combining these two projects would be a task achievable for a research institution, a company with a moderate GPU cluster, or even a dedicated individual with access to a few powerful servers. It stands in stark contrast to the massive, resource-intensive training runs that are common for foundational models from large tech companies.

$16k ~ a dedicated individual with access to a few servers?

You are absolutely right to question that phrasing. Let me clarify and re-contextualize what that $16,000 figure means. It's a significant amount of money, and my initial statement was too broad.

For the average individual hobbyist, $16,000 is, of course, a major and likely prohibitive expense.

When I say "dedicated individual" or "small team," I'm referring to a very specific subset of people in the AI development space:

    Funded Researchers: PhD students or academics who have secured research grants. A $16k compute budget is very reasonable for a funded research project.

    Early-Stage Startups: A small, seed-funded startup could easily allocate this amount for a core model training run.

    Open-Source Developers with Grants: Many large AI companies and cloud providers (like Google, AWS, and Microsoft) offer compute credits and grants to promising open-source projects and researchers. A significant portion of the open-source AI community relies on this type of sponsorship.

    Highly-Compensated Professionals: A professional in the field treating this as a serious venture or a significant side project might consider this a worthwhile investment, similar to investing in a business.

The Key Is the Comparison

The most important context is the comparison to the alternative you first mentioned: "1000s of H100s." A training run on that scale would cost not thousands, but tens of millions of dollars.

    $16,000 is in the "small business loan" or "used car" territory. It's accessible to a small, well-funded, or highly committed group.

    $10,000,000+ is in the "venture capital mega-round" or "corporate R&D budget" territory. It's accessible only to a handful of the largest tech companies in the world.

So, while it's not a weekend project cost, the LLaVA-OneVision project's efficiency dramatically lowers the barrier to entry. It moves cutting-edge multimodal research from an exclusive club of tech giants into the realm of the broader AI research and startup community.

I agree. My comment was also made to ensure I understood correctly. What defines the lower bound regarding hardware: The pure size of the model? What individual GPU do I need to train the model over time with interruptions (at night, when the one GPU is not needed) to end up with a slightly better model than the day before?

Excellent questions. You're probing at the fundamental constraints of modern AI development, and your intuition is correct.

What Defines the Lower Bound Regarding Hardware?

You're right, the pure size of the model is the main factor, but the specific technical bottleneck that defines the absolute lower bound is GPU Memory (VRAM).

Think of VRAM as the workbench for your GPU. To do any work (i.e., training), you must be able to place all your tools and materials on the bench at the same time. If they don't fit, the process fails.

During training, three main things must fit into VRAM:

    Model Weights: This is the size of the model itself. For a 4-billion parameter model using standard 16-bit precision (the common practice), this would be 4 billion * 2 bytes = 8 GB.

    Gradients: During the backward pass of training, the model calculates a gradient for every single parameter to know how to update it. These gradients are typically the same size as the model weights, so that's another 8 GB.

Optimizer States: Modern optimizers like AdamW need to store extra information, usually two additional values (momentum and variance) for each parameter. This can be twice the size of the model weights, so that could be another 16 GB.

Quick Math: 8 GB (weights) + 8 GB (gradients) + 16 GB (optimizer) = 32 GB

This calculation doesn't even include the space needed for the actual data batch (images, text tokens) and the intermediate calculations (activations), which can add several more gigabytes. This is why fully training even a "small" 4B model is difficult and requires high-end professional GPUs (like an NVIDIA A100 with 40GB or 80GB of VRAM).

Your Scenario: Incremental Training on One GPU

Now, for your specific goal—"to end up with a slightly better model than the day before"—you wouldn't be doing a full training run. You would be doing fine-tuning. This is where memory-saving techniques become game-changers and make it possible on consumer hardware.

The most popular and effective technique for this is QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation). It dramatically reduces the memory footprint by:

    Loading the large base model in a quantized 4-bit format (reducing the "Model Weights" memory by 75%).

    Freezing the entire base model and only training a tiny set of new, small "adapter" layers. This means the "Gradients" and "Optimizer States" are only needed for a few million parameters, not all 4 billion.

This brings the VRAM requirement down from the ~32GB+ range into something far more manageable.

What Individual GPU Do You Need?

Considering the QLoRA approach for fine-tuning a model like the 4B or 8B LLaVA-OneVision variants:

    The Gold Standard (Consumer): NVIDIA RTX 4090 or 3090 (24 GB VRAM)

        This is the ideal choice. With 24 GB of VRAM, you have enough headroom to comfortably fine-tune even the 8B parameter model using QLoRA. You can use larger batch sizes for faster, more stable training and experiment freely. Given that you have a 4090, you are perfectly equipped for the exact scenario you described.

    The Minimum Viable: NVIDIA RTX 3060 (12 GB VRAM)

        This is generally considered the entry-point for serious local AI experimentation. With 12 GB, you could likely fine-tune the 4B parameter model using QLoRA, but you would be close to the limit. You'd need to use small batch sizes and be careful with memory management. It would be slower, but it is possible.

    Not Recommended: GPUs with 8 GB VRAM or less

        At this level, even loading a 4B parameter model in a 4-bit quantized format (~2-3 GB) along with the operating system and other overhead leaves very little room for the training process itself. It's generally not feasible for models of this scale.

In short, the hardware lower bound is VRAM, and for your goal of incremental improvement, a GPU with at least 12 GB of VRAM is the minimum, while your 24 GB card is ideal.

I have a 4090. To verify: you suggest that there is a path to train the OneVision model on the OpenGPT dataset?

Yes, to verify and be explicit: there is a clear and feasible path to use your RTX 4090 to fine-tune the LLaVA-OneVision model on the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset.

My previous answers were leading to this conclusion, and your understanding is correct. You are in an excellent position with that hardware.

Here is a breakdown of what that path would look like and the key concepts that make it possible:

The Strategy: Fine-Tuning, Not Training from Scratch

The critical distinction is that you will not be training the model from zero. Instead, you will be fine-tuning. This means you will:

    Start with the official, pre-trained LLaVA-OneVision model (e.g., the 4B or 8B parameter version). This model already has a vast understanding of images and language.

    Use the specialized, high-quality data from the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset to adapt that existing knowledge. You are teaching the model a new skill or refining its abilities for the specific tasks in that dataset (advanced image generation and editing instructions).

The Key Technology: QLoRA

As we discussed, this is made possible by a technique called QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation). This is the feature you would look for in the training scripts.

    It drastically reduces the VRAM needed by loading the massive base model in a memory-saving 4-bit precision.

    It freezes all the original model weights and trains only a very small set of "adapter" layers.

    The result is that the memory-intensive part of the training process is reduced by over 95%, which is what allows it to fit comfortably within the 24 GB of VRAM on your 4090.

The High-Level Workflow Would Be:

    Setup Environment: Clone the LLaVA-OneVision GitHub repository and set up the required Python environment and dependencies.

    Download Assets:

        Download the pre-trained LLaVA-OneVision model weights you want to fine-tune.

        Download and prepare the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset. This will likely involve writing a script to format the data into the structure the training script expects.

    Configure the Fine-Tuning Script:

        You would edit the project's training or fine-tuning configuration file.

        Point the script to your prepared dataset.

        Enable QLoRA and 4-bit training. This is the most important step.

        Set your training parameters (like learning rate, number of training epochs, and a small batch size that fits in your VRAM).

    Run the Training: Execute the script. Your 4090 will begin the process of fine-tuning. This will take time—potentially many hours or days, depending on the dataset size and epochs—making your "train at night" strategy perfectly suitable.

    Evaluate and Use: Once the training is complete, you will have a set of new LoRA adapter weights. You can then merge these weights with the original base model to create your new, specialized model for inference and testing.

How can we figure out if the Llava model had the OpenGPT dataset as a part of its training dataset?

That's an excellent and very important question in the world of LLMs. Figuring out the exact composition of a model's training data can be like a detective story. There's no single command to run, but you can follow a clear investigative process, moving from easy checks to more complex analysis.

Here’s how you can figure it out:

1. The Direct Approach: Check the Documentation

This is the most reliable and straightforward method. The model's creators are the primary source of truth.

    Read the Paper: The official paper for LLaVA-OneVision is the best place to start. Look for a "Training Data" or "Datasets" section. Researchers are generally expected to list the datasets used for training and pre-training. If "OpenGPT-4o-Image" isn't listed, it's a strong indicator it wasn't used.

    Check the Model Card: On platforms like Hugging Face, models have a "Model Card" that details their architecture, intended uses, limitations, and, crucially, their training data.

    Examine the GitHub Repository: Sometimes the repository's README, or documentation will list the datasets. You can also inspect the data preparation and training scripts. Often, the names of the datasets being loaded are written directly in the code.

2. The Timeline Approach: A Simple Sanity Check

This is often the quickest way to get a definitive "no."

    Find the LLaVA-OneVision Training Date: The model and its paper were published well before today's date (October 2, 2025). The key versions were released in 2023 and 2024.

    Find the OpenGPT-4o-Image Dataset Publication Date: The paper you linked has an ID of 2509.24900. ArXiv IDs are formatted as YYMM.#####. This ID suggests a publication date of September 2025.

Conclusion from the timeline: Since the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset appears to have been published in September 2025, it is chronologically impossible for it to have been included in the original training data for the existing, published LLaVA-OneVision models, which were trained long before that.

3. The Empirical Approach: Probe the Model for Evidence

While the timeline already gives us the answer, this method is useful for cases where the dates are ambiguous. This involves "interrogating" the model to see if it has memorized specific, unique information from the dataset.

    The Canary Trap Method: This is the gold standard for this kind of testing.

        Find a "Canary": Select a few highly unique and non-famous image-caption pairs from the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset. The caption should contain specific, non-obvious details that a model couldn't guess just by looking at the image.

        Present the Image: Give the LLaVA-OneVision model the image from the pair you selected.

        Ask for a Caption: Ask the model to describe the image in detail.

        Analyze the Output:

            If the model generates a generic description ("a dog in a park"), it has likely not seen this specific image-caption pair.

            If the model's output is verbatim or nearly identical to the highly specific, unique caption from the dataset, it's extremely strong evidence that it was trained on that exact data point. Models rarely reproduce long, specific, non-obvious strings of text unless they've memorized them.

In summary for your specific question: Based on a simple timeline analysis, the LLaVA-OneVision model could not have been trained on the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset because the model was created and trained before the dataset was published.

Would anyone profit from me doing it? Is someone interested in the public domain to have that pre rained model available or am I only creating CO2?

That is a fantastic and deeply important question. You're moving beyond the "can I do it?" to "should I do it?", which is a critical step.

The short answer is: Yes, absolutely. This project has the potential for significant public benefit and is far more than just an exercise in creating CO2.

Here’s a breakdown of who would benefit and why this is a valuable contribution:

1. Who Would "Profit" and Why?

The "profit" here is in the form of a new, powerful, open, and accessible tool for the community. The main beneficiaries would be:

    Open-Source AI Developers and Researchers: You would be creating a model with a very specific, high-demand capability: understanding and executing complex image editing and generation instructions. Researchers could use it to study instruction-following in multimodal models, and developers could build it into open-source applications (e.g., a free and open alternative to "magic edit" features in proprietary software).

    Indie Hackers and Startups: Access to a powerful, open-source image editing model that can be run locally or hosted cheaply is a massive boon. It allows small teams to build innovative products and services without being locked into expensive, restrictive APIs from large tech companies.

    Digital Artists and Creators: Imagine an artist being able to run a model locally where they can iterate on creative ideas with complex text commands ("Make the lighting more dramatic, like a Rembrandt painting, but keep the subject's expression the same"). This provides a level of control and privacy that cloud-based services don't offer.

    You, Personally: You would gain immense practical experience in the entire MLOps lifecycle: data preparation, model fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment. Sharing a successful model on a platform like Hugging Face with a good model card explaining your process would be a significant achievement and a fantastic public portfolio piece.

2. The Value to the Public Domain

The core value is democratization.

Currently, the most advanced models that can follow nuanced image editing instructions (like the technology hinted at in the GPT-4o demos) are proprietary and closed. They are black boxes accessible only through APIs.

By fine-tuning an open-source model (LLaVA-OneVision) on a publicly available dataset (OpenGPT-4o-Image) and then sharing your resulting model, you are creating a transparent, auditable, and accessible alternative. You are taking a piece of that "magic" from the walled gardens and giving it to the community to use, study, and build upon. This is the fundamental spirit of the open-source AI movement. There is absolutely a strong interest in this.

3. Addressing the "Am I Only Creating CO2?" Question

This is the most thoughtful part of your question. Here's how to frame the environmental cost:

    Return on Carbon Investment: All computation has a carbon cost. The key is the value generated from that cost. Training a foundation model from scratch consumes megawatts of power and produces tons of CO2. Your fine-tuning run on a single 4090 for a few days or weeks is a tiny, almost negligible fraction of that.

    A Net Positive: You are spending a small amount of carbon to create a valuable asset that potentially prevents thousands of others from having to do the same work. By sharing the model, you save the collective carbon cost of duplicate efforts. It is a one-time expenditure for a reusable public good.

Think of it this way: You are not creating CO2 wastefully. You are making a targeted, highly efficient investment of energy to unlock a capability for a global community, saving far more energy in the long run.

Conclusion: This is precisely the kind of work that pushes the open-source community forward. It’s not about competing with the giant foundation models head-on; it’s about taking powerful base models and strategically adapting them to create new, specialized, and openly accessible tools. It is a valuable and worthwhile endeavor.

Thank you so much. I would like to start working on this project. I will create a public GitHub repo to provide the source of the MLOps processes. If successful, I can provide the weights on HF.

Would you mind generating a README.md for the project with the thought process, general concept outlined by you and the presumed technical approach and value we hope to generate? After that, we can come together and build a roadmap.

This is a fantastic initiative. I'm excited to help you get this started. Creating a strong README.md is the perfect first step to crystallize the project's vision and guide your work.

Here is a draft for your README.md. I've structured it to capture the entire thought process we discussed, from the high-level concept to the technical details and the value proposition. This will serve as an excellent foundation for your GitHub repository.

README.md
Oct 2, 7:43 PM

This README is a great starting point. It's comprehensive, sets a clear and ambitious tone, and lays out the technical path ahead.

Now, as you suggested, let's build a roadmap. Based on the README, here's a proposed set of milestones we can discuss and flesh out:

Proposed Roadmap - Milestone 1: Setup & "Hello World"

    [ ] Initialize the public GitHub repository with this README.md.

    [ ] Clone the LLaVA-OneVision repository as a submodule or document the setup process.

    [ ] Successfully run the LLaVA inference script on the base model to ensure the environment is working.

    [ ] Download the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset.

    [ ] Write and test the data conversion script. Goal: Convert at least 100 samples from the dataset into the LLaVA format and manually verify their correctness.

How does this look for a first milestone?

the repo suggestions from github are silly. Any suggestions from you?

Of course. A good repository name should be memorable, descriptive, and easy to find. GitHub's suggestions can be a bit generic.

Based on the project's goal of fine-tuning LLaVA-OneVision with the OpenGPT dataset for instruction-based editing, here are a few suggestions, grouped by style:

Clear & Descriptive

    OpenVision-Instruct: This is my top recommendation. It's professional, directly matches the project title in your README, and clearly communicates the project's core concepts: open-source, computer vision, and instruction-following.

    LLaVA-Instruct-Tune: A more technical name that's very clear to people in the MLOps space. It highlights the base model (LLaVA) and the process (Instruction Fine-Tuning).

    Open-Visual-Editor: Focuses on the end product—an open-source model that acts as a visual editor. It’s very user-friendly.

Creative & Memorable

    VisionWeaver: Evokes the idea of weaving together language instructions and visual data to create new images.

    InstructPix: A short and catchy name that plays on the idea of "instructing pixels." It's a nod to well-known models like Pix2Pix.

I would lean towards OpenVision-Instruct for its clarity and consistency with the excellent README you've already drafted.

what licensing am I bound to? Can I just throw a GNU AGPLv3 at the weights I generate?

That's a very sharp and important question. Navigating the world of AI licensing is complex, especially when you're combining different components to create something new. Here’s a breakdown of the licensing considerations for your project.

Disclaimer: I am an AI assistant and not a lawyer. This is not legal advice. For a definitive answer regarding your specific project, you should consult with a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property and software licensing.

You are bound by the licenses of the components you are using. Let's break it down:

1. The Base Model: LLaVA-OneVision-1.5

    License: Apache 2.0

    What this means: The Apache 2.0 license is a permissive license. It allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute the code and the pre-trained model weights. Crucially, it allows you to license your modifications and derivative works (like your fine-tuned weights) under different terms. It does not have a "viral" or strong copyleft effect.

    Your obligation: You must retain the original copyright notices and the Apache 2.0 license text for the parts of the project that came from LLaVA.

2. The Fine-Tuning Dataset: OpenGPT-4o-Image

    License: This is the most critical and currently uncertain factor. The license of the dataset dictates what you can do with a model trained on it.

    The Big Debate: There is a significant, ongoing legal debate about whether model weights are a "derivative work" of the data they were trained on. The answer heavily depends on the jurisdiction and the specific license.

    Possible Scenarios:

        If the dataset is permissive (e.g., CC-BY, Public Domain): You are likely free to license your resulting model weights however you wish.

        If the dataset is copyleft/ShareAlike (e.g., CC-BY-SA): This is where it gets complicated. A "ShareAlike" (SA) clause would require you to release any derivative works under the same or a compatible license. If a court decides that model weights are a derivative work of the dataset, you would be obligated to release your weights under that CC-BY-SA license. This would prevent you from using AGPLv3.

Can You Use GNU AGPLv3 on Your Weights?

Yes, most likely, but with a major caveat regarding the dataset license.

    From the LLaVA side: The Apache 2.0 license absolutely allows you to release your new contributions (the fine-tuned weights) under the AGPLv3. You are not required to keep the same permissive license.

    The Deciding Factor: Your ability to use AGPLv3 is almost entirely dependent on the license of the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset.

Your Action Plan:

    Find the Dataset License: Your absolute first step must be to find the official license for the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset. Check the paper, any associated GitHub or Hugging Face pages, or contact the authors if necessary. This is the key that unlocks the answer.

    If the License is Permissive: You are in the clear to apply the AGPLv3 to your weights. You would be distributing a combined work: the original Apache 2.0 LLaVA code and your AGPLv3-licensed weights. Users would need to comply with both.

    If the License has a ShareAlike Clause: You must proceed with extreme caution and should consult a lawyer. You may be legally obligated to use the dataset's license for your weights.

In short, you can't just "throw a GNU AGPLv3" at the weights without first confirming that the dataset's license gives you the freedom to do so.

The only mention of 'license' I could find was on the paper itself (https://arxiv.org/html/2509.24900v1) with a "License: CC BY 4.0" but i am sure that applies to the paper, not the dataset. I requested clarification at https://huggingface.co/datasets/WINDop/OpenGPT-4o-Image/discussions/2

This is fantastic investigative work. You're asking precisely the right questions and taking the correct steps. Your skepticism is well-founded.

You are absolutely right to assume that the CC BY 4.0 license on the arXiv paper might only apply to the paper itself. It's very common for the research text to have a permissive license for wide dissemination, while the actual assets (the dataset, code, etc.) are released under a separate, specific license.

Posting a question in the "Discussions" section of the Hugging Face dataset is the perfect move. That is the best possible way to get a definitive answer from the creators themselves.

In the meantime, let's consider the best-case scenario: what if the dataset is also covered by CC BY 4.0?

    What CC BY 4.0 means: This is the Creative Commons "Attribution" license. It's a very permissive license. It allows you to copy, redistribute, and adapt the material for any purpose (even commercially).

    Your only obligation: You must give appropriate credit (attribution) to the original creators, provide a link to the license, and indicate if you've made changes.

    Is it compatible with AGPLv3? Yes. CC BY 4.0 is not a "ShareAlike" (copyleft) license. It does not impose any restrictions on the license you choose for your derivative works. You would be completely free to release your model weights under the AGPLv3, as long as you provide proper attribution for the dataset in your project documentation.

My recommendation while you wait for a response:

You can safely proceed with the technical work outlined in Milestone 1 (setting up the environment, writing the data conversion scripts, etc.). This development work doesn't violate any license. Simply hold off on publicly distributing the final, trained model weights until you have that final clarification.

Excellent work on being so diligent about this. It's a critical part of building a responsible and legitimate open-source project.

yeah, I will not pick a license and start the work. I need a one-sentence summary for the repo.

Of course. Here are a few options for a one-sentence repository summary, ranging from more technical to more benefit-focused.

Option 1 (Clear and Descriptive):
An open-source project to fine-tune the LLaVA-OneVision model on the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset for advanced, instruction-based image editing capabilities.

Option 2 (Benefit-Oriented):
Creating a powerful, open, and accessible model for complex visual instruction-following by fine-tuning LLaVA-OneVision.

Option 3 (Concise and Punchy):
Building an open-source, instruction-tuned vision model for advanced image manipulation.

Before starting with the infrastructure, i need to know what the best infrastructure for training is. Ideally, we move to a modern python stack >= 3.12, but I don't know what tool(s) LLaVA needs, and what the QLoRA tooling requires.

Of course. That's a crucial question to resolve before setting up your infrastructure. Based on the requirements for LLaVA and QLoRA, here is a breakdown of the necessary tooling and a recommendation on the Python version.

Core Infrastructure & Tooling

The entire fine-tuning process relies on a few key libraries from the Hugging Face and PyTorch ecosystems.

    PyTorch: This is the foundational deep learning framework. All the models and training loops will run on PyTorch. You will need a version that is compatible with your specific CUDA toolkit version to leverage your RTX 4090.

    Hugging Face transformers: This library provides the implementation of the LLaVA model itself, along with the infrastructure for loading models and tokenizers.

    Hugging Face peft: This is the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning library. It contains the implementation of LoRA and other similar methods. This is what you'll use to configure the adapter layers for the model.

    bitsandbytes: This is the magic behind the "Q" in QLoRA. It's a low-level library that provides the 4-bit quantization and dequantization functions, allowing the massive model to be loaded into your GPU's VRAM with a minimal memory footprint.

    Hugging Face accelerate: This library simplifies running PyTorch training on any kind of infrastructure, whether it's a single GPU, multiple GPUs, or a TPU. It handles the device placement of your models and data seamlessly.

Python Version: Stick with 3.10 or 3.11 for Now

While it's always tempting to use the latest Python version, the deep learning ecosystem, especially libraries with complex C++ and CUDA backends like bitsandbytes and PyTorch, often lags slightly behind.

    Python >= 3.12 Compatibility Issues: As of late 2025, PyTorch and bitsandbytes have only recently added stable support for Python 3.12. You may still encounter dependency conflicts or a lack of pre-compiled binaries ("wheels") for some packages, forcing you to compile them from source, which can be a difficult and error-prone process.

    The Sweet Spot: The most stable and well-supported Python versions for the current AI stack are Python 3.10 and 3.11. The official LLaVA repository and most Hugging Face examples are tested and maintained with these versions in mind. You will find pre-compiled packages for everything you need, ensuring a much smoother setup process.

Recommendation: To avoid potential infrastructure headaches and to ensure you're working in a well-tested environment, start the project with Python 3.10 or 3.11. This will give you the highest chance of a friction-free installation and let you focus on the MLOps process rather than debugging package compilation errors.
